:::: {.columns}

::: {.column}

::: {.notes}
Asimov's work laid the foundation for ethical considerations in AI development.
:::

## The Three Laws of Robotics

1. A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.
2. A robot must obey the orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.
3. A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Laws.

::: {.fragment}
Asimov later added the Zeroth Law that superseded the others:

0. A robot may not harm humanity, or, by inaction, allow humanity to come to harm.
:::

::: {.notes}
These laws have become a cornerstone in discussions about AI ethics and safety.
:::

## "I, Robot"'s Influence on Modern AI

- Sparked discussions on machine ethics and AI safety
- Influenced researchers to consider ethical implications of AI development
- Concept of "friendly AI" draws parallels to Asimov's laws
- Challenges presented in stories mirror real-world AI alignment problems

::: {.notes}
While not directly implementable, Asimov's laws have shaped thinking about AI governance and ethics in the field.

## 1950: The Turing Test

## The Golden Years (1956-1974)

- Development of early AI programs
- 1957: Frank Rosenblatt develops the Perceptron
- 1964: ELIZA, one of the first chatbots, is created by Joseph Weizenbaum

## 1964: ELIZA, one of the first chatbots {.smaller}

Although ELIZA was limited in terms of actual understanding, it marked an important milestone in the development of AI and human-computer interaction, showing how conversation-based interfaces could influence the perception of intelligence.
:::

::: notes
ELIZA was one of the earliest chatbots, developed in the mid-1960s by Joseph Weizenbaum, a computer scientist at MIT. The program was designed to simulate a conversation between a human and a machine, and it did so by using pattern matching and substitution methodology, a simple but effective form of natural language processing.

ELIZA’s most famous script was called “DOCTOR,” which mimicked a Rogerian psychotherapist. In this role, ELIZA would take users' input and reflect their statements back to them in a way that encouraged further conversation. For example, if a user said, "I'm feeling sad today," ELIZA might respond with, "Why do you think you're feeling sad today?"

While ELIZA's responses were largely superficial, many users were surprised at how human-like they seemed. Weizenbaum created ELIZA to demonstrate how easily people could attribute human-like understanding to a machine, even when its responses were formulaic. He was struck by how quickly people became emotionally attached to the program, despite knowing it was not genuinely intelligent.

Although ELIZA was limited in terms of actual understanding, it marked an important milestone in the development of AI and human-computer interaction, showing how conversation-based interfaces could influence the perception of intelligence.
