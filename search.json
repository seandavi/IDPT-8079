    "text": "Components of an Expert System\nAn ES is built around a knowledge base that contains a vast amount of information, rules, and relationships specific to the domain it’s designed for. This knowledge is typically acquired from human experts, research papers, or other sources. The knowledge base is organized and structured to facilitate efficient reasoning and problem-solving. Think of this as the “rules” or “facts” that the system uses to make decisions. In a medical setting, gathering the knowledge base might involve reviewing textbooks, guidelines, and expert opinions to extract the key information needed to make diagnoses and treatment recommendations.\nThe inference engine is the “brain” of the ES. It uses the knowledge base to draw conclusions, make decisions, and solve problems. The engine applies logical rules and reasoning techniques to arrive at a solution. Note that the inference engine doesn’t “learn” in the traditional sense, but rather applies predefined rules to the input data. New rules can be added to the system to expand its capabilities, but the system doesn’t learn from experience like a neural network would.\nAn ES typically has a user-friendly interface that allows users to input queries, ask questions, or provide data. The system then uses this input to generate a response, provide recommendations, or solve a problem. The user interface can be text-based, graphical, or voice-activated, depending on the application.\nESs use various reasoning techniques, such as forward and backward chaining, to solve problems and make decisions. The reasoning and problem solving capabilities of an ES are what set it apart from traditional software systems. Languages like Prolog are commonly used to implement the logic and reasoning components of an ES."

ESs require ongoing maintenance to keep their knowledge base up-to-date and ensure they remain effective. ESs may struggle with complex, ambiguous, or uncertain problems that require human intuition or creativity.

    "text": "Key features of Prolog\n\nDeclarative Approach: Prolog focuses on what needs to be solved rather than how to solve it. Think of it like giving a set of rules and facts, and then letting the computer figure out the solution on its own, rather than telling it step-by-step how to get there.\nLogical Reasoning: Prolog is built on logic. It uses logical thinking to figure things out, much like how we reason through problems in everyday life. For example, if you tell it certain facts like “All humans are mortal” and “Socrates is a human,” Prolog can figure out that “Socrates is mortal.”\nFacts, Rules, and Questions: Prolog programs are made up of facts (like “Socrates is a human”), rules (like “all humans are mortal”), and questions (like “is Socrates mortal?”). You give Prolog the facts and rules, and then you can ask it questions. It works to find the answers using the information you’ve provided.\n\nIn short, Prolog is like a puzzle solver that uses logic and rules to find solutions, and you don’t have to tell it every step—it figures that part out by itself!"

    "text": "An example Prolog program\nThis example illustrates a simple Prolog program that defines facts, rules, and queries. The program is designed to answer the question of whether Socrates is mortal based on the fact that he is human. In practice, Prolog programs can be much more complex, with many facts, rules, and queries that define a domain of interest.\nIn the code below, everything in a line after a ‘%’ is a comment that explains what the code is doing. Comments are not part of the program itself but are there to help you understand the code.\n% Facts\nhuman(socrates).\n\n% Rules\nmortal(X) :- human(X). \n\n% Queries\n?- mortal(socrates).\n\nExplanation:\n\nFacts:\nIn Prolog, facts are basic statements about things we know to be true. In this case, the fact human(socrates). means that Socrates is a human. This is a piece of information we’re giving to the program. In a medical context, we might have facts like symptom(fever). or history_of(cancer). that represent information about patients.\nRules:\nRules in Prolog define relationships between facts. Here, we have the rule mortal(X) :- human(X)., which means “X is mortal if X is human.” “Variables” in prolog begin with capital letters, so X is a variable. In Prolog, the :- symbol can be read as “if.” So, this rule is saying, “if X is human, then X is mortal.” This is a simple logical relationship that Prolog can use to make inferences.\nQueries:\nWhen we want to ask Prolog a question (or query), we do so by providing a query. For example, the query ?- mortal(socrates). is asking, “Is Socrates mortal?” Prolog will use the facts and rules we’ve provided to answer this question.\nIn this case, it looks at the rule mortal(X) :- human(X). and sees that since Socrates is a human (from the fact human(socrates).), he must also be mortal. So, Prolog will respond with “Yes” or true.\n\n\n\nHow It Works:\n\nhuman(socrates).: This is a fact we already know—Socrates is human.\nmortal(X) :- human(X).: This is a rule that says any human is mortal.\n?- mortal(socrates).: This is the query we ask, and Prolog checks the facts and rules to conclude that Socrates is mortal because he is human.\n\nIn summary, this small Prolog program uses logic to infer that Socrates is mortal based on the information that he’s human. It reflects how Prolog works by defining facts, applying rules, and answering queries logically."

This knowledge base will contain the facts and rules that the system will use to reason and make decisions.

For this exercise, lets assume that the following rules apply:\n\nIf a patient has a runny nose and sneezing with or without a fever, they likely have a common cold.\nIf a patient has a fever, sore throat, and runny nose, they likely have the flu.\nIf a patient has sneezing and a runny nose but no fever, they likely have allergies.\n\nWe can define these symptoms as facts in Prolog, like this:\n\n\n\nSymptom\nProlog Fact Representation\n\n\n\n\nRunny Nose\nsymptom(runny_nose).\n\n\nSneezing\nsymptom(sneezing).\n\n\nFever\nsymptom(fever).\n\n\nFatigue\nsymptom(fatigue).\n\n\nItchy Eyes\nsymptom(itchy_eyes).\n\n\n\nWe are going to simplify the rules for the sake of this exercise, but in a real-world scenario, the rules would be more complex and based on a larger set of symptoms and diagnostic criteria. In this case, we’ll assume that the presence or absence of these symptoms is enough to differentiate between the conditions.\nFor the common cold, we’ll use the following rule:\n\nIf a patient has a runny nose and sneezing but no fever, they likely have a common cold.\nTreatment: Rest, drink fluids, consider over-the-counter cold medicine.\n\nFor the flu, we’ll use the following rule:\n\nIf a patient has a fever, fatigue, and runny nose, they likely have the flu.\nTreatment: Rest, stay hydrated, take anti-fever medication, see a doctor if symptoms worsen.\n\nFor allergies, we’ll use the following rule:\n\nIf a patient has sneezing, a runny nose, and itchy eyes, they likely have allergies.\nTreatment: Avoid allergens, use antihistamines, consult an allergist if needed."

This is where the Prolog programming language comes in. Prolog is a logic programming language that is well-suited for representing and reasoning with complex knowledge and rules. It uses a declarative syntax that allows you to define relationships, rules, and facts in a concise and intuitive way.\nProlog programs consist of a set of facts and rules that define the relationships between different entities in the system.

The program was designed to simulate a conversation between a human and a machine, and it did so by using pattern matching and substitution methodology, a simple but effective form of natural language processing.\nELIZA’s most famous script was called “DOCTOR,” which mimicked a Rogerian psychotherapist. In this role, ELIZA would take users’ input and reflect their statements back to them in a way that encouraged further conversation. For example, if a user said, “I’m feeling sad today,” ELIZA might respond with, “Why do you think you’re feeling sad today?”\nWhile ELIZA’s responses were largely superficial, many users were surprised at how human-like they seemed. Weizenbaum created ELIZA to demonstrate how easily people could attribute human-like understanding to a machine, even when its responses were formulaic. He was struck by how quickly people became emotionally attached to the program, despite knowing it was not genuinely intelligent.\nAlthough ELIZA was limited in terms of actual understanding, it marked an important milestone in the development of AI and human-computer interaction, showing how conversation-based interfaces could influence the perception of intelligence."
